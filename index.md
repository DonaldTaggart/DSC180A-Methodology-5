#### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
While not necessarily its own topic, I find it extremely interesting that a LLM (either on its website or through it API) can be provided with a "role" to undertake. The fact that this can be utilized to force a LLM to effectively adopt a goal, perspective, and methodology for going about a provided task goes to show a weak spot I would not have initially thought of that can be taken advantage of by those with nefarious intentons.

#### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Inspired by my response to the earlier question, I am curious if any given LLM can be provided with a role that endows them with some form of awareness that keeps them vigilant when being asked any question from any user.

#### **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would have liked to have had summer reading assigned because it would made the process of implementing the provided papers much smoother if I had started the fall quarter already having the foundational knowledge regarding LLMs, jailbreaking, and how to organize repository files. Understanding all of this material earlier on would have helped with both understanding and replicating said papers and then determining how to build off of them in some way for the winter quarter.

#### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Hello
